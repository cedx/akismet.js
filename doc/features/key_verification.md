# Key verification
Key verification authenticates your key before calling the [comment check](comment_check.md), [submit spam](submit_spam.md), or [submit ham](submit_ham.md) methods. This is the first call that you should make to Akismet and is especially useful if you will have multiple users with their own Akismet subscriptions using your application.

```
Client#verifyKey(): Promise<boolean>
```

## Parameters
None.

## Return value
A `Promise` that resolves with a `boolean` value indicating whether the client's API key is valid.

The promise rejects with a `ClientError` exception when an error occurs.
The exception `message` usually includes some debug information, provided by the `X-akismet-debug-help` HTTP header, about what exactly was invalid about the call.

## Example

```ts
const {Client} from '@cedx/akismet');

async function main() {
  try {
    const client = new Client('123YourAPIKey', 'http://www.yourblog.com');
    const isValid = await client.verifyKey();
    console.log(isValid ? 'The API key is valid' : 'The API key is invalid');
  }
    
  catch (err) {
    console.log(`An error occurred: ${err.message}`);
  }
}
```
