# Testing
When you will integrate the library with your own application, you will of course need to test it. Often we see developers get ahead of themselves, making a few trivial API calls with minimal values and drawing the wrong conclusions about Akismet's accuracy.

## Simulate a positive (spam) result
Make a [comment check](../features/comment_check.md) API call with the `Author#name` set to `"viagra-test-123"` or `Author#email` set to `"akismet-guaranteed-spam@example.com"`. Populate all other required fields with typical values.

The Akismet API will always return a `true` response to a valid request with one of those values. If you receive anything else, something is wrong in your client, data, or communications.

```ts
import {Author, Blog, Client, Comment} from '@cedx/akismet';

async function main() {
  const author = new Author('127.0.0.1', 'Mozilla/5.0', {name: 'viagra-test-123'});
  const comment = new Comment(author, {content: 'A user comment'});

  const client = new Client('123YourAPIKey', new Blog(new URL('http://www.yourblog.com')));
  const isSpam = await client.checkComment(comment);
  console.log(`It should be "true": ${isSpam}`);
}
```

## Simulate a negative (not spam) result
Make a [comment check](../features/comment_check.md) API call with the `Author#role` set to `"administrator"` and all other required fields populated with typical values.

The Akismet API will always return a `false` response. Any other response indicates a data or communication problem.

```ts
import {Author, Blog, Client, Comment} from '@cedx/akismet';

async function main() {
  const author = new Author('127.0.0.1', 'Mozilla/5.0', {role: 'administrator'});
  const comment = new Comment(author, {content: 'A user comment'});

  const client = new Client('123YourAPIKey', new Blog(new URL('http://www.yourblog.com')));
  const isSpam = await client.checkComment(comment);
  console.log(`It should be "false": ${isSpam}`);
}
```

## Automated testing
Enable the `Client#isTest` option in your tests.

That will tell Akismet not to change its behaviour based on those API calls â€“ they will have no training effect. That means your tests will be somewhat repeatable, in the sense that one test won't influence subsequent calls.

```ts
import {Author, Blog, Client, Comment} from '@cedx/akismet';

async function main() {
  const author = new Author('127.0.0.1', 'Mozilla/5.0');
  const comment = new Comment(author, {content: 'A user comment'});
  const client = new Client(
    '123YourAPIKey',
    new Blog(new URL('http://www.yourblog.com')),
    {isTest: true}
  );
  
  console.log('It should not influence subsequent calls');
  await client.checkComment(comment);
}
```
